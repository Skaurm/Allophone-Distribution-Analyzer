# Allophone-Distribution-Analyzer

## Description
This is an HTML/JavaScript resource that automatically sifts through a language’s dataset in search for minimal pairs and overlapping segment environments, given any number of phonemes. The user inputs the phonemes that they would like to analyze and the language’s dataset, and the program will output its conclusion: which of the segments are allophones of the same/different phonemes, along with any minimal pairs and a full log of every environment where each segment was found. The program shows all of its work.

The program is especially useful for beginners, when it may be difficult understanding different environments and how to conclude their findings. Each result also has a short description to help learners understand the process. Even for non-beginners, this program helps to save lots of time; the biggest time-save occurs when more than 2 phonemes are being analyzed, though this relies on the fact that enough data is given.

3 examples have been provided to show all the capabilities of the program using 3 hypothetical languages.

## Technicalities
This program uses HTML and JavaScript. To run the program, run index.html. The program requires an internet connection as it relies on the Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.

To my knowledge, this program is entirely original, and no similar program exists easily accessible on the web. The data used in the 3 examples are entirely fictional to unrealistically sample and force all of the program’s capabilities. All information on the program is directly borrowed from (or derived from) the course content in chapter 4. The Bootstrap and jQuery libraries are used everywhere on the internet without the need for attribution.
